18. Go back to the Embed API Demo and copy the following code and paste it into index.html: 
```
<script type="text/javascript">
	document.addEventListener("adobe_dc_view_sdk.ready", function(){ 
		var adobeDCView = new AdobeDC.View({clientId: "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>", divId: "adobe-dc-view"});
		adobeDCView.previewFile({
			content:{location: {url: "https://documentcloud.adobe.com/view-sdk-demo/PDFs/Bodea Brochure.pdf"}},
			metaData:{fileName: "Bodea Brochure.pdf"}
		}, {});
	});
</script>
```
19. Paste into index.html.
20. Find the part of the code that says `<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>` and replace it with clientId.
21. In browser, load the web page from your web server to confirm that it loads correctly.

## Exercise 2: Accessing Analytics APIs
1. Go to Default analytics in documentation (https://www.adobe.com/devnet-docs/dcsdk_io/viewSDK/howtodata.html#default-analytics)
2. Review the different types of events available as part of the API.
3. Copy the default analytics sample code from teh documentation.

```
 const eventOptions = {
   //Pass the PDF analytics events to receive.
   //If no event is passed in listenOn, then all PDF analytics events will be received.
   listenOn: [ AdobeDC.View.Enum.PDFAnalyticsEvents.PAGE_VIEW, AdobeDC.View.Enum.PDFAnalyticsEvents.DOCUMENT_DOWNLOAD],
   enablePDFAnalytics: true
 }

 adobeDCView.registerCallback(
   AdobeDC.View.Enum.CallbackType.EVENT_LISTENER,
   function(event) {
     console.log("Type " + event.type);
     console.log("Data " + event.data);
   }, eventOptions
 );
```
4. In index.html, find the code section that you added earlier that looks like below and append the code above after this code:

```
var adobeDCView = new AdobeDC.View({clientId: clientId, divId: "adobe-dc-view"});

              }, {showDownloadPDF: true});
```
5. In your web browser, load the page and open the Console to view the console outputs from the different events as you interact with the PDF viewer.

### Add Switch for capturing events

### Google Analytics
1. To see how you can integrate with Google Analytics, navigate to snippets/eventsSwitchGA.js.
2. Review and use this code as an example if your webpage is tracked using Adobe Analytics and it is already embedded on the webpage.


## Exercise 3: Add Interactivity Based on Events

### Example of Paywall
Navigate to https://www3.technologyevaluation.com/research/white-paper/the-forrester-wave-digital-decisioning-platforms-q4-2020.html to see an example of a PDF behind a paywall. In this exercise we will review how you can add interactivity on top of a PDF viewing experience.
